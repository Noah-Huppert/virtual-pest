        <b>How I met Bill</b>
        <br>
        I was just minding my own business when Bill latched himself onto my computer.
        I don't really want him here but I can't get him off either. So I just decided
        to make the best out of a bad situation and give him a nice place to live.

        <b>Behind the scenes</b>
        <br>
        Behind the scenes Bill's state's are driven by Markov chains. Every second the Virtual
        Pest calculates its next state. Each state has a set of probabilities associated with
        changing to each other state (ex., if "hungry" there is a 20% chance Bill will be
        "thirsty" next and 80% chance Bill will stay thirsty).

        Each stimuli lessens the chance of a certain state occurring multiple times in a row. For
        example the "Tired" state: Normally there is a 50% chance that Bill will remain tired in the
        next state. By clicking the Energy Drink stimuli the chances of Bill being tired in the next
        state is much less.
